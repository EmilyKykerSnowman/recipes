Meatballs recipe

Ingredients:
2 slices crustless white bread, torn into small pieces
1⁄2 cup buttermilk
1 lb ground beef (I use 80/20 hamburger)
1⁄4 cup parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley or 2 teaspoons dried parsley
1 egg
1 teaspoon minced garlic
3⁄4 teaspoon salt

Directions:

Combine bread pieces and buttermilk in a bowl. 
Let the bread and buttermilk sit for 10 minutes.
Then mash, or mix, to a smooth paste.
Add other ingredients and blend well, but be careful NOT to overwork the mixture.
Form 1 inch balls and deep fry them at 310 degrees for 3-5 minutes.
